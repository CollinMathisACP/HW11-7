<h1>Making an Argument</h1>
<p>
One common misconception about curiosity as a motivating force is that it is better for attaining an entry-level amount of knowledge in many subjects instead of going in depth into any of them. One might say that someone who is always curious could be easily distracted, and not focus on any one topic for an extended period of time. I would go about debunking this primarily by stating that if someone is curious about a subject, it is only natural that exploration of that subject would reveal other interesting details. In the interest of not prompting an overkill backfire effect, I would ideally move on to some sort of empirical data to back up my claims. I doubt it would be possible to get ahold of, but data regarding user activity on Wikipedia could be useful to see how people navigate between topics and subtopics, and how much time they spend on each page. So as not to trigger a backfire effect, I would try to keep the discussion hypothetical, that way the other person does not feel attacked. From there, it would be beneficial to add some breadth to my argument, as Cairo states that context can be useful in achieving truth through data visualizations. A study of course selection among college students of certain majors could be helpful, especially as there would likely be trends regarding curiosity in certain subjects by certain majors. With all of these aspects in place, I think there is a solid argument to be made for the value of curiosity.
